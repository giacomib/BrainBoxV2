# BrainBoxV2

## Description

University project to explore and use agile methods (Scrum); to implement Scrum we have done two sprints, in which we have realized an Android application in Java: BrainBox, an app to take notes.

NOTE: the application is not finished, the focus of the project wasn't about the application itself, is was instead on the use of agile methods.
